---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Data Source Priority (for both outbound and return flights):

**When "Use Real Data" Toggle is ON:**
1. **Kiwi.com API** (Primary) - Live flight data with real pricing
2. **Express Backend** (Fallback) - Your backend server if Kiwi fails
3. **Mock Data** (Final Fallback) - Generated locally if all else fails

**When "Use Real Data" Toggle is OFF:**
1. **Express Backend** (Primary) - Your backend server
2. **Mock Data** (Fallback) - If backend is unavailable

### Round-Trip Package Flow:

```
User searches with return date
         ↓
Search outbound flights (YYZ → BOM)
         ↓
   [Uses selected data source]
         ↓
Search return flights (BOM → YYZ)
         ↓
   [Uses SAME data source]
         ↓
Create packages combining both
         ↓
Display top 10 sorted by price
```

## 🎨 New UI Features

### Real-Time Data Toggle Section

- Button: "📝 Use Mock Data" (white with green text)
- ⚠️ Warning if API key is not configured

---

## 🔑 API Configuration

### Required Environment Variables:

**For Kiwi.com Real-Time Data:**
```bash
# frontend/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAPIDAPI_HOST=booking-com15.p.rapidapi.com
```

### How to Get RapidAPI Key:
1. Go to https://rapidapi.com/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Subscribe to Kiwi.com Flight Search API
4. Copy your API key
5. Add to `frontend/.env.local`

## 📊 Testing Guide

### Test 1: Mock Data (Default)
1. Keep toggle OFF (📝 Mock Flight Data)
2. Search: YYZ → BOM, Oct 6 → Oct 30
3. See 15-20 mock flights with round-trip packages
4. **Expected**: Fast response, consistent data

### Test 2: Real-Time Data (Kiwi API)
1. Click "🌐 Use Real Data" button
2. Ensure RapidAPI key is configured
3. Search: YYZ → BOM, Oct 6 → Oct 30
4. Wait for API response (2-5 seconds)
5. **Expected**: Real flights with actual pricing
6. **Expected**: Return flights correctly show BOM → YYZ

### Test 3: Backend Integration
1. Keep toggle OFF
2. Ensure backend_test is running on port 4000
3. Search flights
4. **Expected**: Data from Express backend

### Test 4: Fallback Behavior
1. Turn toggle ON with no API key
2. Search flights
3. **Expected**: Falls back to mock data with console warning

## 🔍 Console Logging

### Helpful Debug Messages:

**Outbound Flight Search:**
```
✈️ Searching flights with Express backend...
OR
🛫 Searching with REAL Kiwi API data...
✅ Real flight data loaded: 20 flights
```

**Return Flight Search:**
```
🔄 Searching return flights for round-trip packages...
Return flight: FROM BOM TO YYZ on 2025-10-30
🌐 Fetching REAL return flights from Kiwi API...
✅ Found 15 real return flights from Kiwi API
✅ Created 10 round-trip packages
Sample package: YYZ → BOM (outbound), BOM → YYZ (return)
```

**Fallback Messages:**
```
⚠️ No real return flights found, falling back to mock data
OR
⚠️ Express backend unavailable, using mock return flights
```

## 💡 Key Improvements

### Before:
- ❌ Only mock data for all flights
- ❌ Return flights used same origin/destination (wrong!)
- ❌ No way to test real API
- ❌ No visual indicator of data source

### After:
- ✅ Real-time data from Kiwi.com API
- ✅ Return flights correctly swapped (BOM → YYZ)
- ✅ Easy toggle to switch data sources
- ✅ Clear visual indicator with status
- ✅ Comprehensive fallback system
- ✅ Real pricing and availability
- ✅ Consistent experience for both outbound and return

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Weekend Trip with Real Data
```
Toggle: ON (🌐 Real-Time Flight Data)
From: LAX
To: LAS
Depart: Friday, Oct 10
Return: Sunday, Oct 12
```
**Result**: Real Vegas flights with actual hotel availability and pricing

### Example 2: International Trip Testing
```
Toggle: OFF (📝 Mock Flight Data)
From: JFK
To: LHR
Depart: Nov 1
Return: Nov 15
```
**Result**: Fast mock data for UI/UX testing

### Example 3: One-Way Flight
```
From: YYZ
To: BOM
Depart: Jan 15
Return: (leave empty)
```
**Result**: Only outbound flights, no packages section

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Toggle shows API key warning
**Solution**: Add RapidAPI key to `frontend/.env.local`

### Issue: No real flights returned
**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid API key
- No flights available for that route/date
- API rate limit exceeded
**Solution**: Check console for error messages

### Issue: Return flights showing wrong direction
**Status**: ✅ FIXED! Return flights now correctly show destination → origin

### Issue: Backend unavailable error
**Solution**: 
1. Check if backend_test is running: `cd backend_test && npm run dev`
2. Verify it's on port 4000
3. Check CORS settings

### Issue: Slow response with real data
**Expected**: Kiwi API takes 2-5 seconds for live searches
**Solution**: Use mock data for quick testing
