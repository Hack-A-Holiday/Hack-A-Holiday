## 🆚 Chatbot vs AI Agent

### ❌ Simple Chatbot (What We DON'T Want)

```
User: "Suggest beach destinations for my budget"
Chatbot: "Some great beach destinations are Bali, Thailand, and Mexico. 
         They're affordable and beautiful!"
```

**Problems:**
- Just giving generic information
- No real data or actions
- Not using tools
- Not being proactive
- Can't actually DO anything

### ✅ AI Agent (What We HAVE Now)

```
User: "Suggest beach destinations for my budget under $2000"

Agent: "Let me search for the best budget-friendly beach destinations 
       for you... 🔍

       Based on current prices and availability, here are my top 
       recommendations:

       1. 🏖️ Cancun, Mexico - $850 total
          • Flights: $320 (round-trip from NYC)
          • Hotels: $530 (5 nights, 4-star beachfront)
          • Why: Best value for money, direct flights available

## 🎯 How It Works Technically

### 1. User sends message

### 2. Agent analyzes with Claude 4 Opus
```javascript
// Agent thinks: "User wants beach destinations with budget constraint"
// Agent decides: "I should use get_destination_info and search_hotels"
```

### 3. Agent calls tools
```javascript
// Tool 1: Get destination data
const destInfo = await executeToolCall({
  name: 'get_destination_info',
  input: { destination: 'Cancun' }
});

// Tool 2: Search hotels
const hotels = await executeToolCall({
  name: 'search_hotels', 
  input: { destination: 'Cancun', budget: 'moderate' }
});
```

### 4. Agent synthesizes results
```javascript
// Combines data from all tools
// Creates structured recommendations
// Adds pros/cons and next steps
```

### 5. Returns actionable response
