if ('Notification' in window && Notification.permission === 'granted') {
  new Notification('🎉 Trip Confirmed!', {
    body: 'Check your profile to see your upcoming trips.',
    icon: '/favicon.ico'
  });
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Booking Flow
1. **User searches** for flights/hotels/packages
2. **User clicks book** → Pending booking saved
3. **External tabs open** → User books on Google Flights/Booking.com
4. **User returns** → Confirmation modal appears
5. **User confirms** → Trip saved + event dispatched
6. **UI updates** → Home page counters increment, profile shows new trip

### Real-Time Updates
