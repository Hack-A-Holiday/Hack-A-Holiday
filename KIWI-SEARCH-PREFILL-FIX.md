# 🎯 FIXED: Kiwi.com Search Pre-Population

## Problem Identified ✅
The beautiful modal was opening, but Kiwi.com wasn't showing the specific flights because we were:
1. Opening two separate one-way searches
2. Not using Kiwi.com's round-trip URL format
3. Flights weren't pre-selected in the search results

## Solution Implemented 🚀

### 1. Created Round-Trip URL Generator
```typescript
getRoundTripBookingUrl(outbound: FlightOption, returnFlight: FlightOption): string
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses Kiwi.com's **round-trip URL format**: `/origin/destination/departDate/returnDate`
- Includes all passenger details (adults, infants)
- Includes cabin class
- Includes currency and sorting preferences

**Example URL:**
```
https://www.kiwi.com/en/search/results/YYZ/BOM/2025-10-21/2025-12-05
  ?adults=1
  &currency=USD
  &sortBy=price
```

### 2. Updated Booking Logic

#### Before:
```typescript
// Opened TWO separate tabs
window.open(outboundUrl);  // YYZ → BOM (one-way)
window.open(returnUrl);    // BOM → YYZ (one-way)
```

#### After:
```typescript
// Opens ONE tab with round-trip search
const roundTripUrl = getRoundTripBookingUrl(outbound, return);
window.open(roundTripUrl);  // YYZ ⇄ BOM (round-trip)
```

### 3. Updated Modal Information

#### Old Message:
- ❌ "Two booking pages will open in new tabs"
- ❌ "Please complete both bookings to secure your round-trip"

#### New Message:
- ✅ "Kiwi.com will open with your round-trip search pre-filled"
- ✅ "Look for flights on [dates]"
- ✅ "Select matching flights to complete your booking"
- ✅ "Prices may vary slightly based on real-time availability"

### 4. Updated Button Text
- **Package Bookings**: "Book Both Flights" → **"Search on Kiwi.com"**
- **Single Flights**: "Proceed to Booking" (unchanged)

## How It Works Now 🎬

### User Flow:
```
1. Click "Book Package" on your app
   ↓
2. Beautiful modal shows flight details
   ↓
3. User reviews:
   - Outbound: YYZ → BOM (Oct 21)
   - Return: BOM → YYZ (Dec 5)
   - Total Price: $1655
   - Savings: $30
   ↓
4. Click "Search on Kiwi.com"
   ↓
5. ONE tab opens with round-trip search pre-filled:
   - Route: Toronto ⇄ Mumbai
   - Dates: Oct 21 - Dec 5
   - Passengers: 1 adult
   - Class: Economy
   ↓
6. User sees all available round-trip options
   ↓
7. User selects the matching flights and books
```

## Benefits 🌟

### For Users:
1. **Simpler**: Only ONE tab opens instead of two
2. **Clearer**: Round-trip search shows all options together
3. **Faster**: Pre-filled search saves time
4. **Better UX**: Can compare different flight combinations
5. **More Flexible**: Can choose alternative flights if preferred

### For Kiwi.com Integration:
1. **Correct Format**: Uses proper round-trip URL structure
2. **Complete Data**: All search parameters included
3. **Better Results**: Shows matched round-trip packages
4. **Price Accuracy**: Displays actual round-trip pricing

## Technical Details 📋

### URL Structure:

#### Round-Trip Package:
```
/search/results/{origin}/{destination}/{departDate}/{returnDate}
```

#### Parameters:
- `adults`: Number of adult passengers
- `infants`: Number of infant passengers (if any)
- `cabinClass`: economy, business, or first
- `currency`: USD
- `sortBy`: price (sorts by cheapest first)

### Example URLs Generated:

**Round-Trip (Toronto ⇄ Mumbai):**
```
https://www.kiwi.com/en/search/results/YYZ/BOM/2025-10-21/2025-12-05
  ?adults=1&currency=USD&sortBy=price
```

**Single Flight (Toronto → Mumbai):**
```
https://www.kiwi.com/en/search/results/YYZ/BOM/2025-10-21
  ?adults=1&return=2025-12-05&currency=USD&sortBy=price
```

## Edge Cases Handled ✅

### 1. Direct Booking URLs
If flights have direct booking URLs from API:
```typescript
if (outbound.bookingUrl && return.bookingUrl) {
  // Open both direct links (legacy behavior)
  window.open(outbound.bookingUrl);
  window.open(return.bookingUrl);
}
```

### 2. Missing Return Date
Single flight bookings still include return date parameter:
```typescript
if (searchRequest.returnDate) {
  kiwiUrl += `&return=${searchRequest.returnDate}`;
}
```

### 3. Multiple Passengers
Correctly handles adults, children, and infants:
```typescript
const passengers = adults + children;
kiwiUrl += `?adults=${passengers}`;
if (infants > 0) {
  kiwiUrl += `&infants=${infants}`;
}
```

## Testing Checklist ✅
