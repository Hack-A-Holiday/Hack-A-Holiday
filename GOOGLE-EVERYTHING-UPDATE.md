# 🎯 Google Everything Update - All Booking Links Fixed

## 📋 Summary

Successfully updated **ALL** booking flows to use Google services (Google Flights & Google Hotels) instead of the problematic Kiwi.com links.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Single Flights** → Google Flights ✈️

**Before:** Clicking "Book Flight" on individual flights opened Kiwi.com with empty results

**After:** Opens Google Flights with pre-filled search

**Function Updated:** `getAirlineBookingUrl()`

```typescript
// Now generates clean Google Flights URLs
const googleFlightsUrl = `https://www.google.com/travel/flights?q=Flights%20from%20${origin}%20to%20${destination}%20on%20${date}`;
```

**User Experience:**
- Click "Book Flight" on any individual flight
- Opens Google Flights with departure airport, arrival airport, and date pre-filled
- User can immediately see flight options and book

---

### 2. **Individual Hotels** → Google Hotels 🏨

**Before:** Hotels opened generic Booking.com searches

**After:** Opens Google Hotels with specific hotel search

**Function Updated:** `getHotelBookingUrl()`

```typescript
// Now uses Google Hotels for better search
const hotelName = encodeURIComponent(hotel.name);
const cityName = encodeURIComponent(hotel.cityName || hotel.address);
const googleHotelsUrl = `https://www.google.com/travel/hotels?q=${hotelName}%20${cityName}`;
```

**User Experience:**
- Click "Select" on any hotel
- Opens Google Hotels searching for that specific hotel name + city
- User can see rates, reviews, and book directly

---

### 3. **Complete Vacation Packages** → 3 Tabs (Outbound + Return + Hotel) 🎁

**Before:** Opened mixed/unreliable booking pages

**After:** Opens **3 Google tabs** in sequence:
1. **Tab 1:** Outbound flight on Google Flights
2. **Tab 2:** Return flight on Google Flights (500ms delay)
3. **Tab 3:** Hotel on Google Hotels (1000ms delay)

**Button Updated:** "Book Complete Package" button in vacation packages section

```typescript
onClick={() => {
  // Tab 1: Outbound flight
  const outboundUrl = `https://www.google.com/travel/flights?q=Flights%20from%20${origin}%20to%20${dest}%20on%20${checkIn}`;
  window.open(outboundUrl, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');
  
  // Tab 2: Return flight (staggered 500ms)
  setTimeout(() => {
    const returnUrl = `https://www.google.com/travel/flights?q=Flights%20from%20${returnOrigin}%20to%20${returnDest}%20on%20${checkOut}`;
    window.open(returnUrl, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');
  }, 500);
  
  // Tab 3: Hotel (staggered 1000ms)
  setTimeout(() => {
    const hotelUrl = `https://www.google.com/travel/hotels?q=${hotelName}%20${cityName}`;
    window.open(hotelUrl, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');
  }, 1000);
}}
```

**User Experience:**
- Click "Book Complete Package" on any vacation package
- 3 tabs open sequentially (avoiding popup blockers)
- Tab 1: Outbound flight search on Google Flights
- Tab 2: Return flight search on Google Flights
- Tab 3: Hotel search on Google Hotels
