# üéâ Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem Diagnosed
The backend was deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk but returned **502 Bad Gateway** errors.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Error 1: Missing Module
```
Error: Cannot find module 'uuid'
Require stack:
- /var/app/current/services/userService.js
- /var/app/current/controllers/authController.js
- /var/app/current/routes/auth.js
- /var/app/current/server.js
```

**Cause**: The `uuid` package was used in `userService.js` but wasn't declared in `package.json` dependencies.

#### Error 2: Package Lock Mismatch
```
npm error Missing: uuid@9.0.1 from lock file
npm error Clean install a project
```

**Cause**: After adding `uuid` to `package.json`, the `package-lock.json` wasn't updated. The build uses `npm ci` which requires an exact match between the two files.

## Solution Implemented

### Fix #1: Add Missing Dependency
**File**: `backend_test/package.json`

Added `uuid` to dependencies:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-agent-runtime": "^3.907.0",
  "@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime": "^3.901.0",
  "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb": "^3.902.0",
  "@aws-sdk/credential-providers": "^3.901.0",
  "@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb": "^3.902.0",
  "axios": "^1.12.2",
  "cookie-parser": "^1.4.6",
  "cors": "^2.8.5",
  "dotenv": "^16.3.1",
  "express": "^4.18.2",
  "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
  "uuid": "^9.0.0"  // ‚Üê ADDED
}
```

### Fix #2: Update Package Lock
**Command**:
```bash
npm install  # Regenerates package-lock.json with uuid
```

**Result**: `package-lock.json` now includes `uuid@9.0.1` with all its dependencies.

### Attempt 1 (Failed - Missing uuid)
- **Time**: 2025-10-16 02:36:24 UTC
- **Error**: `Cannot find module 'uuid'`
- **Status**: Application crashed immediately on startup
- **Health**: üî¥ Red (502 errors)

### Attempt 2 (Failed - Lock file mismatch)
- **Time**: 2025-10-16 02:46:15 UTC
- **Error**: `Missing: uuid@9.0.1 from lock file`
- **Stage**: Build failed during `npm ci --production`
- **Status**: Never deployed

### Attempt 3 (Success ‚úÖ)
- **Time**: 2025-10-16 02:52:35 UTC
- **Changes**: 
  1. Added `uuid` to `package.json`
  2. Updated `package-lock.json` via `npm install`
  3. Committed both files to main branch
- **Pipeline**: All stages succeeded (Source ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Deploy)
- **Health**: üü¢ Green
- **Status**: 200 OK
- **Response**: `{"message":"Hack-A-Holiday backend running!"}`

## Key Learnings

### 1. npm ci vs npm install
- `npm ci` (clean install) requires **exact match** between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Used in CI/CD for reproducible builds
- Always run `npm install` locally after changing `package.json`, then commit the lock file

### 2. Diagnosing 502 Errors
- **502 = Application not responding** (nginx can't connect to app on port 8080)
- Check `/var/log/web.stdout.log` for Node.js startup errors
- Common causes: Missing dependencies, port conflicts, syntax errors

### 3. CodePipeline Automation
- Any push to `main` branch triggers the full pipeline
- Source ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Deploy happens automatically
- Failed builds don't deploy (safe deployment)
