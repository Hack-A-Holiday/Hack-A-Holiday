# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Autonomous Travel Companion is an AI-powered system that autonomously plans complete trips from start to finish. The system takes user preferences (budget, duration, interests, destination) and generates comprehensive itineraries including flight searches, hotel bookings, and local activity recommendations. Built on AWS Bedrock with AgentCore capabilities, it provides intelligent trip planning with memory, observability, and integration capabilities for booking services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want to input my trip preferences (budget, duration, interests, destination), so that the AI can generate a personalized travel itinerary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the travel companion interface THEN the system SHALL display input fields for budget, trip duration, interests, and destination
2. WHEN a user submits valid trip preferences THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the input parameters
3. IF any required field is missing THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation messages
4. WHEN preferences are submitted THEN the system SHALL store user preferences in DynamoDB for future reference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the AI to autonomously search and suggest flights, so that I can see available travel options within my budget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trip preferences include flight requirements THEN the system SHALL search for available flights using integrated APIs or mock data
2. WHEN flight search is completed THEN the system SHALL return flight options sorted by price and relevance to user preferences
3. IF no flights are found within budget THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative dates or nearby airports
4. WHEN flight suggestions are generated THEN the system SHALL include flight details (airline, times, price, duration)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the AI to find and recommend hotels, so that I have accommodation options that match my budget and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN destination and dates are specified THEN the system SHALL search for available hotels in the destination area
2. WHEN hotel search is completed THEN the system SHALL return hotel options filtered by budget constraints
3. WHEN hotel recommendations are provided THEN the system SHALL include hotel details (name, rating, price per night, amenities)
4. IF no hotels are found within budget THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative accommodation types or nearby areas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the AI to suggest local activities and attractions, so that I can discover interesting things to do at my destination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN destination and interests are provided THEN the system SHALL generate activity recommendations based on user interests
2. WHEN activities are suggested THEN the system SHALL include cost estimates, duration, and relevance to user interests
3. WHEN activity recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL organize activities by day within the trip duration
4. IF activities exceed budget THEN the system SHALL prioritize free or low-cost alternatives

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want to see a complete day-by-day itinerary, so that I have a structured plan for my entire trip.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all trip components are planned THEN the system SHALL generate a structured day-by-day itinerary
2. WHEN itinerary is created THEN the system SHALL include flights, accommodation, and daily activities in chronological order
3. WHEN itinerary is generated THEN the system SHALL provide total cost breakdown and ensure it stays within budget
4. WHEN itinerary is complete THEN the system SHALL store the itinerary in S3 and provide access via signed URL

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want to confirm and mock-book my travel arrangements, so that I can simulate the booking process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN itinerary is presented THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation options for flights, hotels, and activities
2. WHEN user confirms bookings THEN the system SHALL simulate booking process and store confirmation details in DynamoDB
3. WHEN booking confirmation is completed THEN the system SHALL generate booking confirmations with reference numbers
4. WHEN bookings are confirmed THEN the system SHALL update itinerary status to "booked" in the database

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive observability and monitoring, so that I can track system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API request is made THEN the system SHALL log request details, response times, and outcomes to CloudWatch
2. WHEN Bedrock agent processes requests THEN the system SHALL trace agent reasoning steps and decision points
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with sufficient context for debugging
4. WHEN system metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track success rates, latency, and resource usage

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the AI to remember my preferences and past trips, so that future recommendations can be more personalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user creates multiple trips THEN the system SHALL store user preference patterns in DynamoDB
2. WHEN generating new recommendations THEN the system SHALL consider historical preferences and feedback
3. WHEN user returns to the system THEN the system SHALL pre-populate forms with previously used preferences
4. WHEN trip history is accessed THEN the system SHALL display past itineraries and allow reuse of successful plans

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to integrate with external travel APIs, so that real-time data can be accessed for bookings and recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external APIs are available THEN the system SHALL integrate with official flight and hotel booking APIs
2. WHEN external APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use sandboxed mock data for deterministic demo functionality
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting and error responses gracefully
4. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate and transform data into consistent internal formats

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive web interface, so that I can access the travel companion from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a responsive React/Next.js interface
2. WHEN trip planning is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading states and progress indicators
3. WHEN itinerary is ready THEN the system SHALL display results in an organized, readable format
4. WHEN user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and smooth navigation
