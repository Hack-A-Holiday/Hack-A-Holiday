## Overview

1. **Country-Based Airport Code Suggestions**
2. **Round-Trip Flight Packages**

---

## Feature 1: Country-Based Airport Code Suggestions

### Description
Users can now type a country name in the Origin or Destination Airport Code fields to see all available airports in that country. This makes it easier to find airports without knowing specific airport codes.

### How It Works
- **Smart Filtering**: As you type in the airport code field, the system searches both airport codes AND country names
- **Autocomplete Dropdown**: When a match is found, a dropdown appears showing all matching airports
- **Rich Information**: Each suggestion displays:
  - Airport Code (e.g., BOM)
  - City name (e.g., Mumbai)
  - Full airport name (e.g., Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj)
  - Country name (e.g., India)

### Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Finding all airports in India
1. Click on the "Origin Airport Code" field
2. Type "India"
3. See dropdown showing:
   - **DEL** - New Delhi (Indira Gandhi International ‚Ä¢ India)
   - **BOM** - Mumbai (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ‚Ä¢ India)
   - **BLR** - Bangalore (Kempegowda International ‚Ä¢ India)
4. Click on any airport to select it

#### Example 2: Finding airports in United States
1. Type "United States" or "USA" in either field
2. See all US airports:
   - **JFK** - New York (John F. Kennedy International ‚Ä¢ USA)
   - **LAX** - Los Angeles (Los Angeles International ‚Ä¢ USA)
   - **ORD** - Chicago (O'Hare International ‚Ä¢ USA)
   - **MIA** - Miami (Miami International ‚Ä¢ USA)

#### Example 3: Traditional airport code search still works
1. Type "JFK" to find New York airports
2. Type "London" to find London airports
3. Type "Paris" to find Paris airports

### Supported Countries & Regions
The system includes airports from all major regions:
- **North America**: USA, Canada, Mexico
- **Europe**: UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, and more
- **Asia**: India, Japan, China, Singapore, Thailand, and more
- **Middle East**: UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Israel
- **Africa**: South Africa, Egypt, Kenya
- **Oceania**: Australia, New Zealand

## Feature 2: Round-Trip Flight Packages

### Description
When both departure and return dates are provided, the system now automatically searches for return flights and creates combined round-trip packages. This saves time and shows potential savings from booking both flights together.

### How It Works
1. **Automatic Detection**: System detects when a return date is provided
2. **Return Flight Search**: Automatically searches for flights from destination back to origin on the return date
3. **Smart Pairing**: Combines outbound and return flights into packages
4. **Savings Calculation**: Shows potential savings compared to separate bookings
5. **Best Deal Highlighting**: The most affordable package is highlighted as "Best Deal"

### Package Display Features
Each package shows:
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Outbound Flight Details**:
  - Departure time and airport
  - Arrival time and airport
  - Airline name
  - Flight duration
  - Number of stops
  - Individual price
  
- üîô **Return Flight Details**:
  - All the same information for the return journey
  
- üí∞ **Package Total**:
  - Combined total price
  - Savings amount (if applicable)
  - "Book Package" button for easy booking

### Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Book a round-trip to Mumbai
1. **Origin**: YYZ (Toronto)
2. **Destination**: BOM (Mumbai)
3. **Departure Date**: 2025-01-15
4. **Return Date**: 2025-01-22
5. Click "Search Flights"
6. **Result**: See up to 5 round-trip packages with:
   - Outbound flight on Jan 15
   - Return flight on Jan 22
   - Total package price
   - Savings amount

#### Example 2: Weekend trip to New York
1. **Origin**: LAX
2. **Destination**: JFK
3. **Departure Date**: Friday, 2025-02-07
4. **Return Date**: Sunday, 2025-02-09
5. Search and see weekend packages with total pricing

#### Example 3: One-way flight (no packages)
1. **Origin**: LHR
2. **Destination**: CDG
3. **Departure Date**: 2025-03-10
4. **Return Date**: (leave empty)
5. Search shows only one-way flights (no packages section)

### Package Sorting
Packages are automatically sorted by:
1. **Price (Low to High)**: Most affordable packages first
2. **Best Deal Tag**: Lowest price package gets special highlighting
3. **Top 5 Display**: Shows the 5 best packages to avoid overwhelming users

### Visual Indicators
- ‚≠ê **Best Deal Badge**: Green badge on the most affordable package
- **Color Coding**:
  - Outbound flights: Blue accent (‚úàÔ∏è)
  - Return flights: Purple accent (üîô)
  - Total price: Bold blue
  - Savings: Green text with üí∞ icon
